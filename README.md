As a developer tool, the main goal of Slicemachine is to perfect the process of working with a CMS while developing components locally.

### 1. Build reusable website sections
We call them slices. Create and iterate on these sections from your own project, without going back & forth with a remote content editor.

It takes a few seconds to generate components and their data models. Everything is then stored and versioned right inside your code.

### 2. Preview your components locally
While you build your components, you probably want to preview them. Slicemachine generates always up-to-date mocks that can be imported in the context of your page. Without querying any remote content!

If you already use Storybook, Slicemachine generates stories for each of your slices. Once your library of slices is ready, publish it to get opinions from your team!

### 3. Ship your library to a page builder
Once you're done iterating with your components locally, publish them to Prismic. You get a full-fledged online content editor, tailored to your components data models. Content editors can preview slices from there and create pages without any help!
