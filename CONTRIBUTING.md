## Local development

Clone the `slice-machine` repository to your local machine.

```
git clone https://github.com/prismicio/slice-machine.git
```

Move into the folder and install the dependencies.

```
cd slice-machine
npm install
```

Start up the dev server.

```
npm run dev
```

Now that the dev server is running you can start the Next.js project used for testing. Move into the `e2e-projects/next` folder and run the `slicemachine:dev` script.

```
cd e2e-projects/next
npm run slicemachine:dev
```

Now you can go to your browser and open `localhost:9999` to see the Slice Machine app up and running with some demo slices and types.
You're now ready to start working on your changes and see them updated in the app.
