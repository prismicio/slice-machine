A command line tool to start [Slice Machine][slice-machine].

## Install

`start-slicemachine` is installed automatically as a dependency to `slice-machine-ui`.

We recommend installing Slice Machine into your project using `@slicemachine/init`:

```sh
npx @slicemachine/init
```

If you want to install `slice-machine-ui` manually, you can do so like this:

```sh
npm install --save-dev slice-machine-ui
```

## Quick Start

Run `start-slicemachine` from your command line to start Slice Machine:

```
npx start-slicemachine
```

Or add it as a `package.json` script to run it even quicker:

```typescript
// package.json

{
	"scripts": {
		"slicemachine" :"start-slicemachine"
	}
}
```

```sh
npm run slicemachine
```

Pass `--open` to automatically launch Slice Machine in your browser:

```
npm run slicemachine -- --open
```
