### New Feature

SliceMachine now supports custom screenshots! ✌️

Previously, screenshots were stored along with your components.
Everytime a change was made to a slice, a new screenshot was generated, erasing the previous one.

This behaviour made it impossible for users to add their own preview file.

These default screenshots are now stored in `.slicemachine`, a special folder that will probaby grow
with more features in the coming weeks - and that you should definitely push to git!

To enable the custom screenshot feature, simply add a `preview.(png|jpg)` to each of your components folders.
When pushing slices to Prismic, the builder will select the screenshot by favouring the custom preview file first,
then the automatic screenshot.

Your editors will then be able to preview your custom screenshot in the editor.

#### Also

We added more options to RichText and fixed a bug in the validation of Image widgets.

#### Oh and...

We now have a changelog 😊
