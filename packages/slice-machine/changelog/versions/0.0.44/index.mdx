### New Features

We're adding 2 features that should help you prototype your components.

<b>Code snippets</b> are now displayed right under each widget field, for both Next and Nuxt users!
We might add more frameworks if they get requested.
<br/><br/>
<b>Mock configuration</b> has been asked by quite a few users. All our widgets now come with a second tab
that lets you configure how you want the mock generator to behave or which value you want to get.

This configuration file is stored in `.slicemachine/mocks` and scopes the configuration by slice.

### Bug fixes

#### Default value on Select widget

Fixed a bug that prevented the "use first value as default" field to be saved to FileSystem.

#### TimeStamp mock

Fixed mock generation for TimeStamp widget field.
