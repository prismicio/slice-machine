// This component is a shim for `react-select`.
//
// The shim will only be included when NODE_ENV === "test". It will be removed
// in production and development builds.
//
// Reason for the shim: `react-select`'s CJS bundle is transpiled using Babel
// and uses the `exports.default` syntax to define its default export. Rollup,
// used by Vitest, treats `exports.default` as a named export called "default".
// SWC, used by Next.js, treats it as a native default export.
//
// We do not have much control over how modules are handled internally, so we
// must adapt around this behavior.

import _Select from "react-select";

let Select = _Select;
